# News Site
The project was to create a classic magazine or newspaper site, including a header, a main news article, a grid of news articles. Also to create a responsive design with the following views; Desktop 4 columns, tablet 2 columns, mobile 1 column. 

## The problem
CSS grid and flexbox was hard to grasp at first. I had a hard time making the items in the header change position in tablet size. I used the study material and help from course mates to solve the coding problems. 
It was hard to always think 'mobile first' but during the project I realised how important that is, whilst doing changes and keeping the code clean and organised.
In the beginning of the project I focused a lot on the design. I spent too much time on this. In future projects I'm going to try and place out boxes and play with the layout first, then add the content and last focus on the design.
